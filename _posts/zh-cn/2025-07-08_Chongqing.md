After the 2025 CSA held in Chengdu, I visited Chongqing, which is only one hour by high-speed railway. 

## The Confluence

My first stop was the Chaotianmen Square, located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River.

## The Rail Transit

The rail transit system is also unique here. Line 2 (Line 3 as well) is high-capacity monorail, famous for its track crossing the inside of buildings. I took these photos in a transfer station between Line 2 and Line 10, which is right above the Jialing River.

## Before the Rainstorm

I returned to the confluence before heading to the airport. I was lucky that, minutes after I leave, the heavy rain began.
