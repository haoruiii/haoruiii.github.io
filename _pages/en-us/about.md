I am now an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Sociology at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/soc). I will also be a student affiliate of the [Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies (LRCCS)](https://ii.umich.edu/lrccs) and the [Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics (CID)](https://inequality.umich.edu). 

My research interests lie in the domain of `social stratification and mobility`. Using `quantitative methods`, I have conducted research to study the role of `education` in mobility, paying attention to the experiences of `contemporary China`. During my graduate studies, I am thinking of trying additional methods, such as comparative and historical approaches, and expanding the social contexts of interest. 

I grow up in [Nanjing, China](https://youtu.be/P-WsMQMg-Hs?si=iQ6FMIWpqyfnNKug). I am a fan of road cycling races, including the Tour de France.
