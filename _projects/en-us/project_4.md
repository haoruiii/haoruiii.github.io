In July 2023, I joined a nine-day workshop in which members conducted field work in Dahe Village (an urban village), Shenzhen, Guangdong Province of China. The group was composed of students from multiple places, studying various majors, and of different ages. The twenty-one of us observed, visited, and interviewed daily lives of over 160 individuals in the neighborhood, including residents, social workers, business-owners, etc. 

We were fortunate to get to know, and even join, this community and everyone who had made it up. As a conclusive report, we organized a village exhibition of Dahe's uniqueness. I also made a video (in Chinese) to record all our experiences during this workshop.

You may want to switch to the Chinese page for more details/descriptions. I would also like to thank 董一瑾 Dong, Yijin and 还心童 Huan, Xintong for their help and effort during the production of this video.
