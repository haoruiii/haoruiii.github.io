I would also like to record my undergraduate research experiences, other than my thesis and SOC 310 project: 

**Exclusionary School Discipline and Student Races in the US: A Systematic Review**

I was an research assistant to Dr. Thomas Drake, School of Education at U-M.

- Co-led the processes of systematic review: decided to investigate African American students, Hispanic students, and Latino students compared to White students; clarified the definition of exclusionary discipline; led the analysis programming using R. 
- Assisted with organizing regular group meetings, monitoring paper collections, and managing group documents. 

**Field Observation: Social Workers in Urban Villages in Shenzhen, China**

- Interviewed 10 social workers in Dahe Village, Shenzhen, who are community hired and who work in NGOs; conducted observations on the processes of their services; collected notes of 8,000+ words. 
- Summarized the characteristics of these social workers, the process of their services, their achievements; analyzed the features and strengths of social work in Shenzhen, and the reasons of its high quality. 
- Composed a report on these discoveries and provided suggestions on quality improvements in Nanjing. 

**Literature Review: “Double Reduction” Policy in China as Part of Its Education Reform**

- Reviewed prior research on “The Guidelines to Further Ease the Burden of Excessive Homework and Off-campus Tutoring for Students undergoing Compulsory Education (Double Reduction)”; read prior studies relevant to distributive justice, relative deprivation, and social mobility. 
- Collected academic comments on Double Reduction policies on the aftermath, including changes in the amount of homework, students’ involvement in shadow-education sessions, students’ examination performances, teachers’ feedback, etc.
